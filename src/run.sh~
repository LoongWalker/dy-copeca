# This shell script shows the execution sequences for Dy-COPECA (Short-cicuted version). We need to have a c prgoram and set of test input. This tool is useful to check the adequecy of test input generated. This tool provides you the MC/DC report.
# 1. Firstly, we have to compile "TestDataFileGeneratorGUI.java" by browsing a C program a Test suite which is generated from KLEE or TRACER-X. This Test suite is a collection of all test data in HEXADECIMAL format. This program will convert all data into integer values, and seperate all test inputs. All test inputs are saved in "src/testcases" folder. After that name the folder according to program's name. 
javac TestDataFileGeneratorGUI.java
java TestDataFileGeneratorGUI
# 2. Secondly compile and execute "PreprocessorGUI.java" by browsing a C program, which generates a list of predicates "Predicates.txt" and "Preprocess.c" file which is actually a file that need to run with test inputs consisting of integer values. 
javac PreprocessorGUI.java
java PreprocessorGUI
mv process.c testcases
cd testcases
# 3. One manual modification need to perform is before executing "Preprocess.c" file. See if any function is called or decalared in program. In function declaration add "FILE *wtfinfile" and in call supply "wtfinfile". This will create Raw version of Extended Truth Table without don't care.
gcc process.c
./a.out
# 4. Supply the Raw ETT file into "non_DC_to_DC.java" file to generate "With_DC_truthTable_fileGeneration.java". 
mv ETTRAW_non_DC.txt ../.
cd ..
javac non_DC_to_DC_multiple.java
java non_DC_to_DC_multiple
# 5. "With_DC_truthTable_fileGeneration.java" file will generate RAW ETT with don't care truth values. Complile and run this java file to generate "With_DC_truthTable.txt".
#javac With_DC_truthTable_fileGeneration.java
#java With_DC_truthTable_fileGeneration
i=1;
for file in With_DC_truthTable_fileGeneration******.java; do 
javac With_DC_truthTable_fileGeneration$i.java;
java With_DC_truthTable_fileGeneration$i;
echo $i
((i=i+1)); 
done
# 6. Execute "ExtendedTruthTableGUI.java" file to finally generate MC/DC report. It requires to supply "Predicates.txt" and "With_DC_truthTable.txt". It will provide "MCDC_report.txt".
javac ExtendedTruthTableGUI.java
java ExtendedTruthTableGUI
rm With_DC_truthTable_fileGeneration*
rm With_DC_truthTable.txt
rm ETTRAW_non_DC.txt
